# LearningCS

**LearningCS** is a personal repository where I document my journey of learning the **C# programming language**. Here you'll find small projects, code experiments, and practical examples focused on understanding core concepts.

## 🚀 Topics I'm Exploring

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Asynchronous programming (`async/await`)
- File handling
- Data structures
- LINQ
- Console applications
- Working with databases
- Clean code and best practices
